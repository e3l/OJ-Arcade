History
***

The arcade first opened on the 2016 Super Bowl® game day (Feb 7) selling popcorn and pinball for 25¢ a game. Our first $30 in profit inspired us to make a business we called OJ Arcade™, O for Owen and J for Jacob. We quickly added a homemade ball toss game (Ball in the Pipe™) and other homemade games. In the middle of the summer we acquired a candy machine and filled it with Jelly Bellies®.  We searched for a new game and immediately got a Donkey Kong® classic machine with 60 games in one. We started host birthday parties and community events such as block parties. Then, after the Holidays, we now a vintage 1980s Atari RoadBlasters Arcade Game.
